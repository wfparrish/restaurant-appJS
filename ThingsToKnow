Have you correctly set your PATH to point at your Git installation?

You need to add the following paths to PATH:

C:\Program Files\Git\bin\
C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\
And check that these paths are correct â€“ you may have Git installed on a different drive, or under Program Files (x86). Correct the paths if necessary.

use a semi-colon between each path to set multiple paths
